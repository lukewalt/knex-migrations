ORM :
(object-relational mapping) is a programming technique for CONVERTING DATA BETWEEN INCOMPATIBLE TYPE SYSTEMS in object-oriented programming languages. We use ORM tools to get our databases to talk to our code, even though the database speaks SQL and our code is written in JavaScript.

KNEX:
is useful for creating and managing our migrations, seeding the database, and creating queries. Knex can be used by itself, or in conjunction with bookshelf

BOOKSHELF:
 is a JavaScript ORM for Node.js, built on the Knex SQL query builder. Bookshelf cannot be used without also using Knex. Bookshelf is the tool we will use to create models of our data and also query the database

MIGRATIONS : Allow you to update your tables
